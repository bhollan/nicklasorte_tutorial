# Tutorial: Basic_Functions

This project is a powerful tool for running large-scale *geospatial simulations*, such as modeling wireless signal coverage. It is built to be **highly efficient** by running calculations in *parallel* on multiple processor cores. A key feature is its **robust status tracking**, which allows long simulations to be paused and resumed without losing work. Finally, it turns complex numerical results into easy-to-understand **visual maps**.
